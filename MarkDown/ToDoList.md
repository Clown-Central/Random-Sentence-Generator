General Plan
=
### STEP 1:

_**OR**_

* allow user to create own wordbank

_**OR**_

* don't do either of those

  * Complex Sentence Structure (i.e. Dependent clause, Independent Clause (Combine two sentences with commas))
  * Semi-colons

Pain
=
* user input
* "is"
* tenses

* using verbs as nouns (gerunds)
* parallel structure (ex. "he *runs* and *jumps*")
